Final Project Assignment (part 3).
"archive.zip" is the data file, zipped to reduce the size so that Github let us upload it. Please download it and unzip the file next to the jupyter notebook so it can read the file. Or download it directly from Kaggle from "https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/real-or-fake-fake-jobposting-prediction".
